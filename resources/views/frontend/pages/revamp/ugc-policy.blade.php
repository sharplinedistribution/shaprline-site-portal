                    <h1 class="font-oswald fw-bold text-color-primary text-capitalize mb-3" style="font-size:50px;">Unauthorized Content for UGC DSPs (Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok, YouTube CID)</h1>


                   
                    <p>Not all sound recordings are appropriate for distribution to DSPs that deal with user generated content (UGC) such as <b>Facebook, Snap, TikTok</b> & <b>YouTube Content ID</b>. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>The reason is that those DSP use the sound recording that you distribute to them to identify all matching sound recordings across their UGC content. So if your sound recording is not fully original or owned by you, distributing to those DSPs will cause you to claim content which is not yours to claim.</b> </p>
                    <p style="color:#fbda03"><b>Please remember that Sharpline Distro is penalized by the DSPs for inappropriate distribution and that you risk having your access to these DSPs removed if you regularly distribute inappropriate content to them.</b> </p>
                    <p style="color:#fbda03"><b>You also risk having your royalties withheld if you regularly distribute inappropriate content to them</b></p>
                   
                    <p><b>Generally Speaking</b>, only the following types of sound recordings are eligible for distribution to DSPs dealing with UGC content:</p>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <li><b>Sound recordings that are sonically distinct from audio you do not own </b></li>
                        <li><b>Sound recordings for which you have exclusive UGC rights</b></li>
                        <li><b>Non-duplicate content (instrumental versions, medleys, etc. of tracks you have already distributed)</b></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>‍‍The list below is solely meant to provide examples and is not meant to be exhaustive: </p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Public domain content or audio files that contain public domain content. </li>
                        <li>Content that contains very generic and common sounds. For example, audience applause, white noise, or simple drum loops. But the following may also be invalid: meditation, yoga, or sleep music.</li>
                        <li>Content that contains non-exclusive beats or sounds. For example, songs that contain drum loops or samples that are contained in sample packs or music creation software.</li>
                        <li>Content that you licensed from another party on a non-exclusive basis. For example, content that was licensed for soundtracks or compilations, or that you licensed from a production music catalog.</li>
                        <li>"Soundalike" covers or remixes</li>
                        <li>Karaoke versions of songs.</li>
                        <li>Classical music content.</li>
                        <li>Live versions of songs that sound very similar to the recorded version of that same song.</li>
                        <li>Derivative versions of recordings owned by other parties. For example, remixes of songs for which you do not own the original version.</li>
                        <li>Re-recorded masters, re-mastered tracks, or remixed tracks of songs where you do not own the original recording.</li>
                        <li>Any audio where you do not control the right to claim UGC videos that use 100% of the delivered audio.</li>
                        <li>An <b>alternate</b> version of a sound recording that has already been distributed to the DSP. For example:
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>an instrumental/karaoke version</li>
                                <li>a remaster version</li>
                                <li>a lofi version</li>
                                <li>a sped up or slowed down version<br></li>
                                <li>a pitch shifted version
                                    <b>Please note:</b> these versions <b>may</b> be acceptable in some rare cases. If you find an instance of an alternate recording that is not being claimed by your original track, please email our Support team to request whether it would be appropriate to distribute the alternate recording. Please provide the ISRC of both the original and alternate recordings.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>A <b>variation</b> of a sound recording that has already been distributed to the DSP. For example:
                            <ol tyle="1">
                                <li>a shorter/longer version (for example a medley, a mashup or a concert version where the sound recording is not significantly different from the one previously distributed to the DSP)</li>
                                <li>DJ set, a continuous mix, or other similar compilations where the individual sound recordings have already been distributed to the DSP</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Video gameplay footage.</li>
                        <li>Non-music content such as (but not limited to):
                            <ol tyle="1">
                                <li>comedy recordings</li>
                                <li>film recordings (that are not the musical score to a film)</li>
                                <li>speeches</li>
                                <li>prayer recordings</li>
