                    <h2 class="text-color-primary mb-3">REFUND & CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>

                    <p>As soon as you have made your payment, youâ€™ll receive access to the <strong>SHARPLINE DISTRO SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong> services. You may therefore only receive a refund of your paid Subscription if SHARPLINE DISTRO is in direct violation/breach of these Subscriptions Terms of use. Any refund approved will be paid out to the same method of payment you used when paying for SHARPLINE SUBSCRIPTIONS. You are not entitled to a refund if we terminate your Account because you have breached SHARPLINE DISTRO Agreements.</p>

                    <p>We are in no way liable or responsible for any third party failures. We will, however, do our best to help fix the problem.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-color-primary mb-3 mt-4">Chargebacks</h2>

                    <p>If we receive a chargeback or payment dispute from a credit card company or bank, your service and/or project will be suspended without notice. A chargeback fee (issued to recover fees passed on to us by the credit company), plus any outstanding balances accrued as a result of the chargeback(s) must be paid in full before service is restored, files delivered, or any further work is done. Instead of issuing a chargeback, contact us to address any billing issues. Requesting a chargeback or opening a dispute for a valid charge from us is fraud, and is never an appropriate or legal means of obtaining a refund. Please read and make sure you fully understand our refund policy prior to making a payment. </p>
